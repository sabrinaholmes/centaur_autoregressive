In this task, you have to repeatedly choose between two slot machines labeled U and P.

When you select one of the machines, you will win 1 or 0 points.

You will receive feedback about the outcome after making a choice.

The environment may change unpredictably, and past success does not guarantee future results.
You’ll need to adapt to these changes to keep finding the better machine.
You will play 1 game in total, consisting of 100 trials.

In this task, you have to repeatedly choose between two slot machines labeled U and P.

When you select one of the machines, you will win 1 or 0 points. 

Your goal is to choose the slot machines that will give you the most points.
You will receive feedback about the outcome after making a choice.

The environment may change unpredictably, and past success does not guarantee future results.
You’ll need to adapt to these changes to keep finding the better machine.
You will play 1 game in total, consisting of 100 trials.
